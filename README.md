# The Intergenerational Consequences of Climate Change on Later Life Mortality: Evidence from Individual-Level U.S. Death Records
 
SocArXiv Working Paper: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ndu4/

This repository contains python code for generating estimates of in utero and early life exposure of temperature on later life mortality. The original code was done in R and a full translation is currently in process. The current analysis file replicates the results presented in the lower left panel of Figure 3.

### Abstract
Global climate change can impact populations rapidly through the increased occurrence of natural disasters and climate extremes, but also through long-term, gradual changes that alter environmental conditions and impair biological processes. Here, I investigate whether ambient temperaturesin utero and during the early years of life are associated with reductions in life expectancy. I combine monthly, state-level climatological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with high-resolution, individual-level mortality data from the CenSoc Project, which consists of cleaned and harmonized Social Security Administration death records from 1988-2005. Results indicate that exposure to higher ambient temperatures during gestation and the first four years of life are associated with increased mortality riskin later life for white men from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but not other groups. It is likely that the effect of climate variability on later life mortality for non-white men is overshadowed by structural systems of racism that impact health stratification. Overall, the results emphasize how climate change has already begunto imprint itself onto demographic processes.
